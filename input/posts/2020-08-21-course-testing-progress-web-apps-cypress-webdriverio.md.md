Today my new course [Testing Progressive Web Apps](https://bit.ly/PSPWATesting) has been published and I'm pretty excited for it (like usual!).

## What I Learned

I learned quite a bit while developing this course because in order to test a PWA, you need to *have* a PWA in the first place!

For the course I developed the [Carved Rock Fitness Order Tracker](https://bit.ly/PSPWATestingSample) which is an open source sample application for demo purposes.
