I have a friend who is doing their first open source contribution through [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) this year, which is a yearly event to encourage open source participation.

In their email, they asked:

> Is there any etiquette or expectation for how much coding help one can ask for when taking up an issue and contributing?

What a good question! Imagine yourself feeling pretty psyched to take on a Hacktoberfest issue and when you start to dig around, understand the codebase, you start to realize there could be several solutions and are starting to feel intimidated. 

Is it OK to ask for help? Would that be rude to the maintainers? 

The short answers are **Y
