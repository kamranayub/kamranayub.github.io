I have a friend who is doing their first open source contribution through [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) this year, which is a yearly event to encourage open source participation.

In their email, they asked:

> Is there any etiquette or expectation for how much coding help one can ask for when taking up an issue and contributing?

What a good question! Imagine yourself feeling pretty psyched to take on a Hacktoberfest issue and when you start to dig around, understand the codebase, you start to realize there could be several solutions and are starting to feel intimidated. 

Is it OK to ask for help? Would that be rude to the maintainers? 

The short answers are **YES** and **NO**. Here is my longer answer!

## If the project is participating in Hacktoberfest, this is expected!

There was a little bit of drama this year because historically projects did not necessarily opt into Hacktoberfest and were being spammed with low-effort PRs (or outright useless PRs). However, the [rules have changed](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) and now repositories can opt-in in several ways:

They have a `hacktoberfest` topic in their GitHub project, like this:

Or, maintainers are using the `hacktoberfest-accepted`  when accepting PRs or issues, like this:

If one of these is true, the
