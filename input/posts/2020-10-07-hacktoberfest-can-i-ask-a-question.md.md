I have a friend who is doing their first open source contribution through [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) this year, which is a yearly event to encourage open source participation.

In their email, they asked:

> Is there any etiquette or expectation for how much coding help one can ask for when taking up an issue and contributing?

What a good question! Imagine yourself feeling pretty psyched to take on a Hacktoberfest issue and when you start to dig around, understand the codebase, you start to realize there could be several solutions and are starting to feel intimidated. 

Is it OK to ask for help? Would that be rude to the maintainers? 

The short answers are **YES** and **NO**. Here is my longer answer!

## If the project is participating in Hacktoberfest, this is expected!

There was a little bit of drama this year because historically projects did not necessarily opt into Hacktoberfest and were being spammed with low-effort PRs (or outright useless PRs). However, the [rules have changed](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) and now repositories can opt-in in several ways:

They have a `hacktoberfest` topic in their GitHub project, like this:

![Screenshot of a repository with "hacktoberfest" topic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/563819/95412517-bd885800-08ee-11eb-883a-6620f19d0c0e.png)

Or, maintainers are using the `hacktoberfest-accepted`  when accepting PRs or issues, like this:

![hacktoberfest-accepted label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/563819/95412776-5919c880-08ef-11eb-8a63-f58f6bc4e3e4.png)

If one of these is true, the project is considered opted-in to Hacktoberfest.

My expectation as a contributor would be that if a project opted into Hacktoberfest, especially with the **topic** approach, they are expecting to help you with making quality contributions.

Now since we at [Excalibur](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur) have always opted-in each year, I can tell you that **we expect people to ask questions!** We try to triage and choose potential Hacktoberfest issues ahead of time (heh, in "Preptember") but we know that people will likely have questions.

After all, first-time contributors can't be expected to have answers to everything, of course you will need some help along the way. This is especially true for anything beyond mere typos.

## But will my question be welcomed?

Now this is getting at a different issue, unrelated to Hacktoberfest specifically and more related to toxicity in the open source world. And let's be real: open source can be toxic.

Here's what I recommend to help avoid a toxic project until it's too late: "scout" a potential project beforehand. Does it have a Code of Conduct? Do the maintainers seem to follow it? How do they react to external contributors asking questions? Are they helpful? How do they review their own code?

Doing some prep work on your part beforehand I think will help having to ask this question in the first place.

## Where should I ask?

The approach I recommend is to first ask within issues, assuming there's a Hacktoberfest issue you're taking. This is also where you'd volunteer to take the issue (like, "üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hey, I'd love to try and take this on!").

At that point, maintainers should see your interest and expect that you'll have questions as you get farther into it.

If you have questions right away, like about the design, proposal, or a general question, the issue is where I'd ask.

Once you create a fork, clone the project, and make your branch, you'll be exploring the code. On a new project, I always visualize this process like spelunking a cave system. You reveal one area, and then reveal the next, and that might have any number of offshoot paths or trails back to previous areas, etc. You can get lost in a cave and you can get lost in a codebase.

At some point, I'd be **surprised** if you didn't have a question. You might be listening to a voice in your head, "You can't ask a question like this, it's a silly question, I will look like a fool, and what will they think of me?" **Don't listen!** It is not a sign of
