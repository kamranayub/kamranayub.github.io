That was fast. Last I checked in with you, half the year had already passed. Then I planned to do a third quarter update and suddenly it was the end of the year. I even have a draft of the third quarter newsletter and now I'm just rolling it into the year-end newsletter.

Again let's start with a review of what I set out to do in 2019, as of [my last update](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-07-12-quarterly-2-update).

## Goals in Review

### Primary Goals

**Professional**

- ‚úÖ Publish 1 Pluralsight course on Azure or TypeScript or React ~~by September~~
  - I just published [Contributing to an Open Source Project on GitHub](tbd) a week before January!
- ‚úÖ [Publish 4 Pluralsight guides](/guides) on React & TypeScript by May
- ‚úÖ [Speak at NDC MN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIejhIX7ObE) on a TypeScript topic
- ‚õî Publish 5 technical articles on the blog about Azure, TypeScript, or React
  - *2 out of 5* ain't bad! Check out [safe destructuring in TypeScript](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-06-26-typescript-safe-destructuring-patterns) and [using Storybook in a monorepo](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-09-12-using-storybook-in-a-monorepo).

**Personal**

- ‚õî Pay off all non-mortgage debt
  - We paid off most of it except Cassie's school loan, which will be gone by November 2020, if not sooner. Instead of paying it all off, we are saving for a car purchase (in cash) for March/April.
- ‚úÖ Passive income should account for 2% of earnings, 1099 income for 5%
  - Passive income as a % of W-2: **2.08%**
  - 1099 income as a % of W-2: **2.89%**
  - **Total side earnings:** 4.97%!
- ‚úÖ Replace my PCs at home with a single good Ultrabook/Notebook ~~and a NAS~~
- ‚õî Push 3 substantive updates to KTOMG throughout the year: Steam review revamp, Raven 4 upgrade, and Linux hosting
  - I completed 2 major updates: RavenDB 4 upgrade and IGDB migration. I am partially done with the 3rd update.

**DIY**

- ‚úÖ ~~Learn how to cut trim/baseboard and~~ finish the nursery
  -  Let's leave this at just paint since I decided to leave the trim.

### Stretch Goals

**Professional**

- ‚úÖ Set up a [quarterly newsletter](https://kamranicus.com/newsletter)
  - But I need to actually send it out _every_ quarter üòÖ
- ‚õî Publish 1 more Pluralsight course on Azure or TypeScript or React
- ‚õî Publish 4 additional Pluralsight guides throughout the year
- ‚õî Participate in 1 Pluralsight Mentoring session
- ‚õî Become a Microsoft MVP with a focus on Azure/TypeScript content
- ‚õî Speak at a JSConf or ReactConf event
  - No luck but I [did speak at MDC 2019](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-10-08-mdc-2019-flexible-ui-architecture-react-graphql)
- ‚õî Speak at the React MN meetup about TypeScript or GraphQL
  - I did speak at the .NET User Group on RavenDB, though!
- ‚õî Record a YouTube video walkthrough of my [Raspberry Pi baby monitor](https://kamranicus.com/guides/raspberry-pi-3-baby-monitor) written guide
  - I put out a feeler video instead, to see if there was any interest.

**Personal**

- ‚õî 1099 income should account for 12% or more (+2% over 2018)
  - Again, this wasn't my focus for 2019 and probably won't be for 2020 either. I'll readjust my goals accordingly.
- ‚õî Travel completely free somewhere in the US with wife and 2 kids using miles/points
  - This summer we did a trip up to Voyageur National Park with friends and rented a cabin
  - This goal will be for Summer 2020 and 2021, as we are gearing up for a **huge** trip in 2021, more info later!
  - We did earn 80,000 travel rewards points though, which will go towards those trips
- ‚õî Participate in Ludum Dare during the spring

**DIY**

- ‚õî ~~Install luxury vinyl plank in my office~~
- ‚õî ~~Replace baseboard/trim in my son's bedroom~~ Paint son's bedroom trim.

### Unplanned Accomplishments

I like including this because it goes to show you can't predict everything for the year!

- üèÜ Wrote [freelance technical articles](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-04-04-ravendb-data-modeling-with-indexes) for RavenDB
- üèÜ Started [a new blog](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-09-10-looks-good-to-us-blog-launch) with Cassie
- üèÜ Wrote [a small app](https://reachfi.app) for tracking my savings rate
- üèÜ Reached a savings rate of **40%**, more than double last years. Maxed out 401k, HSA, daycare FSA, both our Roths, and partially contributed to Cassie's 403b and 457b. I still can't believe we were able to accomplish that, it's huge!
- üèÜ Started a new role at work and was promoted, now working on [Target.com](https://target.com)

## Reflection

Wow, I had a great 2019! There are quite a few partial or incomplete goals up there but all the important things were hit: new course, lots of writing, shoring up personal finances, in addition to some unplanned accomplishments like our new craft blog.

## Let's Go 2020

I feel like each year this list gets smaller and smaller -- which is good, I think. I would like to stay focused on what's important and will move the ball forward.

By the way I should just mention that I haven't truly shared *the why* behind these goals. I have a why but I am not ready to blog about it yet. Just know I have 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year goals in mind when I write these and all these goals work towards those larger ones. You have to have [the why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) nailed down to work towards, otherwise your goals exist in isolation.

### Professional

- Publish 1 Pluralsight course
- Write 2 articles on React, TypeScript, RavenDB, or Azure
- Write 4 freelance articles
- Speak at NDC MN and one other regional conference

### Personal

- Get [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) to make a profit
- Get [Looks Good to Us](https://looksgoodtous.com) to make a profit
- Passive and 1099 income should cover 10% of our annual expenses<sup>1</sup>
- Maintain a 40% annual savings rate
- Migrate to Ghost for this blog
- Have one [sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/kamranayub)

### DIY

- Finish last egress window cover
- Finish one basement-related project

### Stretch

- Publish 1 more Pluralsight course
- Speak at a conference outside Minnesota

## Looking forward

The theme of 2020 is "Do more of what works." Clearly, courses and freelance writing went well in 2019 so I'm continuing the trend. I already have two paid opportunities for articles for early 2020 so I increased the goal to four total. 

I would _love_ to do one course in first half of 2020 and another in back half of 2020 but it really depends on my other personal goal: making KTOMG profitable. To accomplish that, I'll be working pretty hard on adding some features and infrastructure to the site. It may be that I will only do one course again just so I can focus my effort on KTOMG.

<sup>1</sup>: Last year I worded this goal differently, in relation to a % of total earnings or W-2 wages. Instead, I realized that was the wrong way to think about it: I should think of it in terms of _% of annual expenses._ That's what really matters since that's what we spend. This is why [The Gap](https://esimoney.com/the-gap-is-the-key-to-wealth/) is an important concept to understand.
