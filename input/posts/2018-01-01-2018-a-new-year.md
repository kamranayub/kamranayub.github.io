It's good to have goals. Without goals, you're aimlessly wandering around on this space rock with nothing to do and no one to answer to. Some folks like that but I'm not one of them--I like having goals, for near and long-term. I have career goals that I work on with my manager, these are overall professional and community goals to help me personally grow.

I [got a lot done in 2016](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-01-02-year-in-review) and continued the trend in 2017, let's break it down and end with my 2018 goals.

# 2017 Year in Review

## Life

- Achievement Unlocked: Father. My son was born in February!
- I [started a new job](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-08-28-joined-target) at Target in August

## Publishing

Some very exciting milestones were reached in 2017: my first course was published and I became a Pluralsight author!

- I [published my Introduction to TypeScript course](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-01-31-introduction-to-typescript-course-packt-publishing) on January 31
- In October, I [accepted a contract](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-10-10-becoming-a-pluralsight-author) to author my first Pluralsight course on RavenDB 4! It's almost done so I will be an "official" author in 2018. This was a huge accomplishment!

## Open Source

Overall, I'm still finding time to contribute to open source. My number of contributions was lower than 2016 but this year I had a new baby so I figure that's pretty good!

- [34 PRs closed for Excalibur.js](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Akamranayub)
- [840 contributions in 2017](https://github.com/kamranayub?tab=overview&from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31)
- In April, worked on "[I Just Wanted Groceries](https://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-38)" for the Ludum Dare 38 game jam
- In October I [started streaming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3ac-9HYUzQjbIWk7BczVfPqVD2_BNWhE) every other Thursday on Twitch, working on OSS projects. I did 4 sessions with 3 recorded videos.

## New Tech

- I got my first Raspberry Pi and [built a baby monitor](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-02-21-building-a-raspberry-pi-3-baby-monitor-livestream-audio-video). My guide continues to be my most popular article on my site!
- [Played with GraphQL](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-10-27-frontend-masters-node-api-graphql) and continue working with GQL full-time at work (it's awesome)
- I'm using "older" AngularJS at work but [integrating it with modern tools](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-10-06-webpack-karma-jest-babel-angularjs)
- [Messing with Drone CI](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-11-20-node-chrome-headless-drone-image) at work
- Did some [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pulls/kamranayub) earlier in the year
- Did [some VSTS extension](https://github.com/rschiefer/MSDeployAllTheThings/pull/6) stuff
- Did [some](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-02-04-powershell-dsc-git-lfs-binaries) Git LFS [stuff](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-06-14-downloading-git-lfs-files-from-tfs-vsts) with Powershell and DSC

## Speaking and Conferences

I already reached one of my goals for 2018 "on accident," which was doing a workshop.

- In December, I revealed I'll be [doing a half-day workshop](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-12-18-workshop-bots-javascript-node-minnewebcon) at MinneWebCon 2018 on Azure bots
- I [spoke at Midwest.js 2017](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-07-14-midwestjs-react-typescript) on React and TypeScript
- I attended [MS Build 2017](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-02-01-build-2017) which was a lot of fun
- I gave the same talk from Midwest.js at Target's internal "InnerConf" conference

## Games

- [Made a game](https://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-38) for Ludum Dare 38
- [Finished](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/users/kamranicus/lists/played/?sortBy=DateAdded) Horizon: Zero Dawn, Dishonored 2, Life is Strange, and Super Mario: Odyssey. Haven't beaten Zelda yet.

# 2018 Goals

In 2016 I didn't lay out my goals in a post, I had them in my head. I'd like to write them down here so I can compare how I did at the year end. Let's do it!

## Primary Goals

- Publish 1 more Pluralsight course (excludes one in progress)
- Host a half-day workshop (scheduled for April)
- Participate in a LD game jam
- Attend and present at 2 conferences
- Attend and present at a local user group
- Continue doing code livestreams

## Stretch Goals

My primary goals are based on previous milestones that I think I can continue. I also want to have some stretch goals to work towards:

- **Become a Microsoft MVP:** I spread the love around TypeScript and Azure a lot in my talks and work, I'd like to work towards becoming an MVP.
- **Publish 2 more Pluralsight courses:** I'm confident I can do at least 1 course in 2018, I'd love to do two!
- **Host a full-day workshop**: This one will be a tough one but with a half-day workshop goal already in progress, I should try for a full-day--even if it's at work and not publicly. Target hosts internal workshops and I've already signaled my intent to do one for 2018.
- **Stream 10 sessions**: I streamed 3 sessions in 2017 and took a holiday break. In January I want to start back up and continue it for the rest of the year, if I can make it work.

Phew, that's a lot! We're going to see if I can achieve some of these in 2018 and what ends up carrying over to 2019. Good luck working towards your own goals for this new year!
