I help maintain the [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com) web-based game engine. Excalibur was written from the ground up in TypeScript. Luckily, early on we started to adopt a tool called [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org) which could generate a rich API documentation site for TypeScript-based projects.

## Linking to API Symbols

TypeDoc has a compelling feature to [link to API symbols](http://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/#symbol-references) using a `[[symbolName]]` or `{@link symbolName}` syntax. This was awesome because we could write "user-facing" documentation and easily create maintainable links to the raw API symbols.

We separated user-facing documentation into separate `.md` files and this approach had been working well for us in the past years but there were several downsides:

- The "user" documentation was locked into the TypeDoc site and theme
- While TypeDoc was customizable, it was still hard to do more complex things like custom components (think MDX which is React + Markdown)
- It wasn't cohesive--we had a separate main site and you'd expect to find docs there.

We needed to do something different and _ideally_ have these user docs hosted within the main site **but still maintain the ability to easily link to API docs**.

## Migrating to Gatsby.js

 Awhile back, I converted the site to be statically generated using [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) and this has proved to be a good decision. Gatsby allows us to customize all the aspects of the site including the way we generate documentation.

Gatsby uses a GraphQL-based sourcing architecture where you can add any kind of "source" of data--this could be Wordpress, the GitHub API, or basically _any_ external piece of data you wanted. These source plugins take the data from one place and _transform_ it into GraphQL nodes that Gatsby can understand and make available to your pages statically. This makes Gatsby incredibly versatile and customizable using a consistent architecture.

Gatsby also has the idea of _transformers_. Transformers take input, usually an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and run it through processors that make changes. For example, there's [gatsby-transformer-remark]([https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/)) that takes Markdown AST and parses it using Remark.

Using a combination of _sources_ and _transformers_ you can basically transform one source of data into whatever you want as the output.

## Creating a TypeDoc Gatsby Source

When we migrated our user documentation, we didn't want to lose the ability to link to the API symbols using the convenient `[[symbol]]` syntax. In order to maintain that, we needed a way to source the TypeDoc JSON (or AST) into our Gatsby site.

For that purpose, I made an npm package [gatsby-source-typedoc](https://npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-typedoc). This will allow you to run TypeDoc against a TypeScript project and it will take the generated structure and store it as a GraphQL node for querying within your Gatsby app.

For example, here's what [Excalibur's Gatsby config looks like](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excaliburjs.github.io/blob/site/gatsby-config.js#L10):

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-typedoc',
    options: {
      src: [
        `${__dirname}/ex/edge/src/engine/index.ts`,
        `${__dirname}/ex/edge/src/engine/globals.d.ts`,
        `${__dirname}/ex/edge/src/engine/files.d.ts`,
        `${__dirname}/ex/edge/src/engine/excalibur.d.ts`,
      ],
      typedoc: {=
        excludePrivate: true,
        tsconfig: `${__dirname}/ex/edge/src/engine/tsconfig.json`,
      },
    },
  },
]
```

This will then allow you to query for the TypeDoc JSON content in a Gatsby page:

```js
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  typedoc(typedocId: { eq: "default" }) {
    internal {
      content
    }
  }
`

export default function MyPage({ data: { typedoc } }) {
	const typedocContent = JSON.parse(typedoc?.internal.content);
	
	// do something with that data...
}
```

With this source package, it is enough to where you could build a custom Gatsby-based TypeDoc site since you now have complete access to the entire TypeDoc structure for your project. We didn't need to go that far, since we are happy with the TypeDoc default theme we use.

But we're still missing something important: parsing those special TypeDoc `[[symbol]]` links in our MDX-based documentation.

## Parsing TypeDoc Symbol Links in Markdown

We write our user documentation using MDX, which is Markdown and React. For example, here's one snippet of document from the [Introduction page](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/intro):

```md
To create a new game, create a new instance of [[Engine]] and pass in
the configuration ([[EngineOptions]]). Excalibur only supports a single
instance of a game at a time, so it is safe to use globally.
You can then call [[Engine.start|start]] which starts the game and optionally accepts
a [[Loader]] which you can use to [load assets](/docs/assets) like sprites and sounds.
```

Notice how we have multiple symbol links denoted by the `[[ ]]` syntax, including some with aliases like `[[Engine.start|start]]`.

If you run this through a Markdown parser, the only link that gets transformed is the "load assets" link because by default, Markdown has no idea what the `[[ ]]` syntax is! Somehow, we need to take the GraphQL TypeDoc source node(s) we generated and then run our Markdown through a _transformer_ to convert these links to Markdown links.

To accomplish this, I released two packages: [remark-typedoc-symbol-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-typedoc-symbol-links) and [gatsby-remark-typedoc-symbol-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-remark-typedoc-symbol-links).

Here is how this works in Gatsby, which was a completely new learning experience for me:

- Gatsby loads the MDX file
- Gatsby then runs it through `gatsby-plugin-mdx`
- `gatsby-plugin-mdx` runs the Markdown through Remark, a Markdown parser
- Remark supports plugins, that can take the Markdown AST (mdast) and modify it
- Gatsby supports special Gatsby Transformer Remark plugins which have access to _both_ the Gatsby API **and** the Markdown AST
- This pipeline uses [unified.js](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) as the underlying API at the lowest level

So, what I needed to do was to make a Gatsby Remark Transformer plug-in. Since Gatsby just delegates down to Remark, I was able to split this up into two packages, just in case someone wanted to use the Typedoc symbol transformer outside Gatsby. The symbol transformer only needs one additional piece of input: the TypeDoc AST.

To hook this all up is a matter of configuring the plugins to work with each other, which is documented on the [README of gatsby-remark-typedoc-symbol-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-remark-typedoc-symbol-links). The approach differs if using with the Gatsby MDX plugin or Gatsby Remark transformer but they essentially do the same thing: pass the generated TypeDoc AST to the symbol link plugin.

The end result is symbol links in the documentation:

ðŸŽ‰ Huzzah!

## Want to make your own Gatsby plugins?

It was a learning experience for me to understand the way plugins were authored as there are a lot of moving parts and I was unfamiliar with the tools for working with AST and Remark. There is "documentation" in these sense of basic examples but I had to dive through other plugin source code to really

I have just started production on a Pluralsight course for authoring Gatsby plugins where I hope to dive deeper into how to do this in a step-by-step fashion (it's a "playbook"-style course, just the essentials to get it done!).
