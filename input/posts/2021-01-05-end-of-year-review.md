It's time to reflect on the year and my what a year it's been. I'll start by saying that COVID-19 is no joke and it's still just as important today to stay safe and mask up.

## Thankfulness

I don't typically choose "themes" for the year but for 2020 I think it was chosen for me: **thankfulness**. There was a lot to be thankful for myself and my family and friends during a horrible time.

I am thankful that no family members close to me have been taken by the virus but nearly everyone has gotten it, some with very minor symptoms, others with moderate symptoms, and still others with longer-term effects like fatigue and loss of smell/taste (which I think has returned by now for them at least). I'm almost certain that I had it since Cassie was positive in November but I plan to ask for an antibody test this month to know for sure. When I took the test after feeling a bit sick, I came out negative. The kids' daycare was struck hard with about 6 teachers testing positive so there was a couple weeks they had to close down over Thanksgiving break.

The pandemic has been a terrible event and we have friends who have suffered health-wise and job-wise from it. I'm thankful that we've been able to stay healthy as a family and remained at our jobs. I hope that continues in 2021. Cassie has certainly taken it the hardest being in a school setting where she's had to work from home and trying to help kids in need remotely over Zoom is proving to be stressful and difficult. There are many jobs where being present physically is important and hers is one of them as a social worker. Even though she's back at school, it still doesn't feel safe and I think we've learned that almost no one is appropriately prepared for when teachers or students test positive -- with mixed messages or delayed communication, or lack of communication altogether. It's super unfortunate.

## 2020 Reflection

I'm an optimistic and positive person and even though 2020 was a dumpster fire for the world, it helps me to focus on the many moments for me as an individual and us a family that were positive. 

- 👩‍💻 My work turned 100% remote which for _me_ was a positive and a long-time goal that I want to maintain going forward. 
- 🌲 We spent a lot of time exploring locally, in Minneapolis. I think we visited at least a dozen new-to-us parks and outdoor areas around the metro. 
- 🚲 We discovered a renewed love of biking and we included the kids. This was amazing for our wellness and was a fun family activity in the evenings and during the day.
- 🚙 We bought a used minivan and we bought it _in cash_ instead of financing it which was a major accomplishment. We had saved for over a year to achieve that!
- ✊🏿 We partipated in protests and activism. At the site of the George Floyd murder, we stood in solidarity with others in our community to stand up for Black Lives. We tried to attend as many rallies as we could safely do and we even had the kids help clean up in the aftermath to show them what it means to be involved.

Despite the hurt and the sadness, both in our local community and the world as a whole, we managed to carve out those positive moments for ourselves and that's something to be very thankful for.

## 2020 Goals in Review

The first thing I want to say, to anyone, is that if you are writing or reflecting on your own 2020 and you got less done than you planned... give yourself a break. Our way of life was upended, the pandemic has affected all of us in some way or another. If you got _anything_ done, you should be proud. For many, having motivation to "get things done" and "be productive" was far from their minds.

Let's review what I had set out to do for 2020 and where I ended up.

### Content

- ✅ Publish 1 Pluralsight course: I published [Testing Progressive Web Apps](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2020-08-25-course-testing-progress-web-apps-cypress-webdriverio)!
  - ❌ **Stretch:** 2 courses. I didn't release two courses but I **did** update my [Azure CORS with Storage](https://bit.ly/PSAzureStorageCORS) course
- ✅ Write 2 articles on React, TypeScript, RavenDB, or Azure
  -  [Why You Don't Need Types in JSDoc When Documenting TypeScript](https://dev.to/kamranayub/why-you-don-t-need-types-in-jsdoc-when-documenting-typescript-1pb0)
  - [Using Storybook to Build a Better... Game Engine?](https://dev.to/kamranayub/storyflow-using-storybook-to-build-a-better-game-engine-296l)
  - See RavenDB ones below!
- ✅ Write 4 freelance articles
  -  Throttling Requests Using RavenDB for [.NET](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5260137/Throttling-Outgoing-HTTP-Requests-in-a-Distributed) and [Node.js](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5260913/Throttling-Outgoing-Requests-in-Node-js)
  - [Role of Indexing in RavenDB, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2020-05-26-ravendb-indexing-mongodb-postgresql)
  - [What's New in RavenDB 5.0](https://ravendb.net/articles/whats-new-in-ravendb-50)
- ❌ Migrate to Ghost for this blog
  - No dice, I spent much less time on this blog and focused more on the DIY blog (see below!)
- ❌ Speak at NDC MN and one other regional conference
  - I actually spoke instead [at MDC in May](https://bit.ly/StorybookForGameEnginesMDC2020) virtually and then the [React Minneapolis user group](https://www.meetup.com/React-Minneapolis-Meetup/events/270736371/) and I even did an ad-hoc talk at THAT.us conference 

### Financial

- ❌ Get [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) to make a profit
  - Still no dice yet, I focused on starting a community with Discord integration in 2020
- ❌  Get [Looks Good to Us](https://looksgoodtous.com) to make a profit
  - LGTU has not made a _profit_ but it has earned _revenue_ which is still an impressive feat for a 1-year old blog! It earned exactly $16 but there is still earnings yet to be paid out that bring it into the $20-30 range. That's **almost** profitable 😂
- ✅ Passive and 1099 income should cover 10% of our annual expenses
  - It actually covered **14%** of our expenses, including the lump minivan payment. With the van, we spent more in 2020 but without it, we spent less than 2019 💪
- ✅ Maintain a 40% annual savings rate
  - We blew past 40% and reached a **52%** savings rate for 2020 😲 How did we spend more and yet save more? Money-in rose from 2019 by a whopping 

I activated [my GitHub sponsor profile](https://github.com/sponsors/kamranayub). If you want to support me directly, that's a way to do it. I am not sure what to expect from this but I'll be _pleasantly_ surprised if I get at least one sponsor in 2020.

- 🙏 Have one sponsor on GitHub

### DIY

I still feel like I'm in the "learning" phase of DIY but I am starting to get comfortable knowing what I want to do around the house. I have one specific project in mind I'm very motivated to do and it would teach me everything about framing and drywall in a small, controlled space. I'd like to build a closet around the sump pump in our basement family room (which is otherwise just exposed in plain sight 😑).

- 🛠 Finish the last egress window cover
- 🛠 Finish one basement-related project
- 🛠 **Stretch**: Finish an upstairs home project

### Unplanned Accomplishments

I like including this because it goes to show you can't predict everything for the year!

- 🏆 Released an open source package for [managing browser permissions in Cypress](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2020-07-17-cypress-browser-permissions)
- 🏆 Released [two Typedoc Gatsby plugins for Excalibur docs generation](https://github.com/kamranayub?tab=repositories&q=gatsby&type=source&language=)
