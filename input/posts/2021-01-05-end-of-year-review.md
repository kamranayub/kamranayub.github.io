It's time to reflect on the year and my what a year it's been. I'll start by saying that COVID-19 is no joke and it's still just as important today to stay safe and mask up.

## Thankfulness

I don't typically choose "themes" for the year but for 2020 I think it was chosen for me: **thankfulness**. There was a lot to be thankful for myself and my family and friends during a horrible time.

I am thankful that no family members close to me have been taken by the virus but nearly everyone has gotten it, some with very minor symptoms, others with moderate symptoms, and still others with longer-term effects like fatigue and loss of smell/taste (which I think has returned by now for them at least). I'm almost certain that I had it since Cassie was positive in November but I plan to ask for an antibody test this month to know for sure. When I took the test after feeling a bit sick, I came out negative. The kids' daycare was struck hard with about 6 teachers testing positive so there was a couple weeks they had to close down over Thanksgiving break.

The pandemic has been a terrible event and we have friends who have suffered health-wise and job-wise from it. I'm thankful that we've been able to stay healthy as a family and remained at our jobs. I hope that continues in 2021. Cassie has certainly taken it the hardest being in a school setting where she's had to work from home and trying to help kids in need remotely over Zoom is proving to be stressful and difficult. There are many jobs where being present physically is important and hers is one of them as a social worker. Even though she's back at school, it still doesn't feel safe and I think we've learned that almost no one is appropriately prepared for when teachers or students test positive -- with mixed messages or delayed communication, or lack of communication altogether. It's super unfortunate.

## 2020 Reflection

I'm an optimistic and positive person and even though 2020 was a dumpster fire for the world, it helps me to focus on the many moments for me as an individual and us a family that were positive. 

- üë©‚Äçüíª My work turned 100% remote which for _me_ was a positive and a long-time goal that I want to maintain going forward. 
- üå≤ We spent a lot of time exploring locally, in Minneapolis. I think we visited at least a dozen new-to-us parks and outdoor areas around the metro. 
- üö≤ We discovered a renewed love of biking and we included the kids. This was amazing for our wellness and was a fun family activity in the evenings and during the day.
- üöô We bought a used minivan and we bought it _in cash_ instead of financing it which was a major accomplishment. We had saved for over a year to achieve that!
- ‚úäüèø We partipated in protests and activism. At the site of the George Floyd murder, we stood in solidarity with others in our community to stand up for Black Lives. We tried to attend as many rallies as we could safely do and we even had the kids help clean up in the aftermath to show them what it means to be involved.

Despite the hurt and the sadness, both in our local community and the world as a whole, we managed to carve out those positive moments for ourselves and that's something to be very thankful for.

## 2020 Goals in Review

The first thing I want to say, to anyone, is that if you are writing or reflecting on your own 2020 and you got less done than you planned... give yourself a break. Our way of life was upended, the pandemic has affected all of us in some way or another. If you got _anything_ done, you should be proud. For many, having motivation to "get things done" and "be productive" was far from their minds.

Let's review what I had set out to do for 2020 and where I ended up.

### Content

- ‚õî Migrate to Ghost for this blog
  - No dice, I spent much less time on this blog and focused more on the DIY blog (see below!)
- üåì Speak at NDC MN and one other regional conference
  - To give myself credit, I applied to over 11 conferences in 2020 but I didn't apply to NDC MN mainly due to a feeling of overcommitment and general feelings of unease/stress/anxiety.
  - I actually spoke instead [at MDC in May](https://bit.ly/StorybookForGameEnginesMDC2020) virtually and then the [React Minneapolis user group](https://www.meetup.com/React-Minneapolis-Meetup/events/270736371/) and I even did an ad-hoc talk at THAT.us conference 

### Financial

- ‚õî Get [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) to make a profit
  - Still no dice yet, while it has earned _some_ revenue, I instead focused on starting a community with Discord integration in 2020
- ‚õî  Get [Looks Good to Us](https://looksgoodtous.com) to make a profit
  - LGTU has not made a _profit_ but it has earned _revenue_ which is still an impressive feat for a 1-year old blog! It earned exactly $16 but there is still earnings yet to be paid out that bring it into the $20-30 range. That's **almost** profitable üòÇ
- ‚úÖ Passive and 1099 income should cover 10% of our annual expenses
  - It actually covered **14%** of our expenses, including the lump minivan payment. With the van, we spent more in 2020 but without it, we spent less than 2019 üí™
- ‚úÖ Maintain a 40% [annual savings rate](https://reachfi.app/)
  - We blew past 40% and reached a **51%** savings rate for 2020 üò≤ Even though we technically spent more in 2020, household income increased for the year by **34%** which resulted in higher savings. üìà Want to track your own savings rate? Use my free [ReachFI PWA app](https://reachfi.app/)!
- ‚úÖ Have one sponsor [on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/kamranayub)
  - **I did it!** I had ONE sponsor in 2020 for ONE month for $5. üôè

### DIY

- ‚úÖ Finish the last egress window cover
  - I did it and [blogged about how I built it](https://looksgoodtous.com/diy-custom-framed-egress-window-cover/).
- ‚úÖFinish one basement-related project
  - I actually did **two** projects technically, [a closet around a sump pump](https://looksgoodtous.com/tag/stair-storage-series/) and a new doorway to our utility room.
- ‚õî **Stretch**: Finish an upstairs home project
  - The basement projects took about 3 months to complete and that took me to the end of 2020.

### Unplanned Accomplishments

I like including this because it goes to show you can't predict everything for the year!

- üèÜ I did some mockups for a future main floor renovation

### Reflection on accomplishments

When I start these year-end posts I forget about how much I _actually_ accomplished in 2020, wow! I have a system I started in 2019 where I track work for my "hustling" on Trello. This lets me easily bring up what I've accomplished for the year which makes me feel great! It also is just an effective way to manage and plan my pipelines of work (more on that below).

## 2021 Systems and Habits (no goals?!)

In 2020, there were two books I read that made an impact on me. [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735211299/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735211299&linkCode=as2&tag=kamranicus-20&linkId=a2011094da6e2c411fab9235f8b5876d) and [The Practice: Shipping Creative Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593328973/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0593328973&linkCode=as2&tag=kamranicus-20&linkId=18c80c1b7d5dab9f9ef3ebe8526eb311) by Seth Godin (affiliate links). 

In *Atomic Habits*, James speaks about the power of habits and systems in lieu of having goals. The idea is that you cannot effectively reach your goals without having the proper habits in place to achieve them. And once you have a system in place or develop a habit, you will naturally reach goals because that is just **who you are as a person**.

In *The Practice*, Seth shares is many years of wisdom on what it means to ship creative work effectively to build "a practice." In other words, what does it take to move from being an amateur (in the pure sense of the word) to be

With that in mind, for 2021 I want to try and focus on **improving the systems that are working for me**, **introducing new systems**, and **breaking out of bad habits that work against me**. Now of course, in order to know what habits you want to build and break, you need some vision of what you want in the future. The type of person you want to be.

For myself in 2021, I'd like to be **a speaker**, a **DIYer**, a **technology instructor**, and **an entrepreneur** (not in any specific order). So now, with the decisions that I make, I can say to myself, "Is this what someone who is a (speaker|DIYer|instructor|entrepreneur) would do?" I can also start to ensure I have the right systems and habits in place to become the type of person I want to be.
