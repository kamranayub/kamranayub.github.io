It's time to reflect on the year and my what a year it's been. I'll start by saying that COVID-19 is no joke and it's still just as important today to stay safe and mask up.

## Thankfulness

I don't typically choose "themes" for the year but for 2020 I think it was chosen for me: **thankfulness**. There was a lot to be thankful for myself and my family and friends during a horrible time.

I am thankful that no family members close to me have been taken by the virus but nearly everyone has gotten it, some with very minor symptoms, others with moderate symptoms, and still others with longer-term effects like fatigue and loss of smell/taste (which I think has returned by now for them at least). I'm almost certain that I had it since Cassie was positive in November but I plan to ask for an antibody test this month to know for sure. When I took the test after feeling a bit sick, I came out negative. The kids' daycare was struck hard with about 6 teachers testing positive so there was a couple weeks they had to close down over Thanksgiving break.

The pandemic has been a terrible event and we have friends who have suffered health-wise and job-wise from it. I'm thankful that we've been able to stay healthy as a family and remained at our jobs. I hope that continues in 2021. Cassie has certainly taken it the hardest being in a school setting where she's had to work from home and trying to help kids in need remotely over Zoom is proving to be stressful and difficult. There are many jobs where being present physically is important and hers is one of them as a social worker. Even though she's back at school, it still doesn't feel safe and I think we've learned that almost no one is appropriately prepared for when teachers or students test positive -- with mixed messages or delayed communication, or lack of communication altogether. It's super unfortunate.

## 2020 Reflection

I'm an optimistic and positive person and even though 2020 was a dumpster fire for the world, it helps me to focus on the many moments for me as an individual and us a family that were positive. 

- 👩‍💻 My work turned 100% remote which for _me_ was a positive and a long-time goal that I want to maintain going forward. 
- 🌲 We spent a lot of time exploring locally, in Minneapolis. I think we visited at least a dozen new-to-us parks and outdoor areas around the metro. 
- 🚲 We discovered a renewed love of biking and we included the kids. This was amazing for our wellness and was a fun family activity in the evenings and during the day.
- 🚙 We bought a used minivan and we bought it _in cash_ instead of financing it which was a major accomplishment. We had saved for over a year to achieve that!
- ✊🏿 We partipated in protests and activism. At the site of the George Floyd murder, we stood in solidarity with others in our community to stand up for Black Lives. We tried to attend as many rallies as we could safely do and we even had the kids help clean up in the aftermath to show them what it means to be involved.

Despite the hurt and the sadness, both in our local community and the world as a whole, we managed to carve out those positive moments for ourselves and that's something to be very thankful for.

## 2020 Goals in Review

The first thing I want to say, to anyone, is that if you are writing or reflecting on your own 2020 and you got less done than you planned... give yourself a break. Our way of life was upended, the pandemic has affected all of us in some way or another. If you got _anything_ done, you should be proud. For many, having motivation to "get things done" and "be productive" was far from their minds.

Let's review what I had set out to do for 2020 and where I ended up.

### Content

- ✅ Publish 1 Pluralsight course: I published [Testing Progressive Web Apps](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2020-08-25-course-testing-progress-web-apps-cypress-webdriverio)!
  - ❌ **Stretch:** 2 courses 
- ✍ Write 2 articles on React, TypeScript, RavenDB, or Azure
- ✅ Write 4 freelance articles
  -  Throttling Requests Using RavenDB for [.NET](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5260137/Throttling-Outgoing-HTTP-Requests-in-a-Distributed) and [Node.js](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5260913/Throttling-Outgoing-Requests-in-Node-js)
  - [Role of Indexing in RavenDB, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL](https://kamranicus.com/posts/2020-05-26-ravendb-indexing-mongodb-postgresql)
  - 
- 👻 Migrate to Ghost for this blog

I enjoy speaking but I don't intend for it to take over my life. Doing one or two large conferences a year is enough for me! I would still _love_ to get a chance to speak outside Minnesota, so I've applied to KCDC, NEJS, and React NYC.

- 🎤 Speak at NDC MN and one other regional conference, **Stretch:** Speak outside MN.

### Financial

Now that I finished two major migrations for KTOMG, I want to work on getting my first paying user. To do that will require some more infrastructure work but I feel confident I can make it happen in 2020! I'm also feeling the friction of a heavy web front-end stack so I'd like to simplify it a bit.

- 📈 Get [Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) to make a profit

Right now LGTU doesn't cost us much, about $15 per month. I'd like to earn at least that much in affiliate revenue for 2020.

- 📈 Get [Looks Good to Us](https://looksgoodtous.com) to make a profit

I modified the financial goals from last year to take a different perspective. Rather than measuring side income in terms of W-2 income, I'm comparing it against our annual expenses which is much more under our control. In 2019, it covered 8% of our expenses which is **awesome.** We also maintained a respectable 40% savings rate (see also [The Gap](https://esimoney.com/the-gap-is-the-key-to-wealth/)) and I want to maintain that momentum going into 2020. It will actually be tougher since we have to buy a new (used) vehicle.

- 💰 Passive and 1099 income should cover 10% of our annual expenses
- 💵 Maintain a 40% annual savings rate

I activated [my GitHub sponsor profile](https://github.com/sponsors/kamranayub). If you want to support me directly, that's a way to do it. I am not sure what to expect from this but I'll be _pleasantly_ surprised if I get at least one sponsor in 2020.

- 🙏 Have one sponsor on GitHub

### DIY

I still feel like I'm in the "learning" phase of DIY but I am starting to get comfortable knowing what I want to do around the house. I have one specific project in mind I'm very motivated to do and it would teach me everything about framing and drywall in a small, controlled space. I'd like to build a closet around the sump pump in our basement family room (which is otherwise just exposed in plain sight 😑).

- 🛠 Finish the last egress window cover
- 🛠 Finish one basement-related project
- 🛠 **Stretch**: Finish an upstairs home project
