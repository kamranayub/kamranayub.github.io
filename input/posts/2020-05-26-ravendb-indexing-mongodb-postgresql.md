I recently was engaged to write an article on how RavenDB indexing compares to MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I had a lot of fun writing it because I finally got to dive deeper into how MongoDB and PostgreSQL query engines work under the covers. I was actually surprised to be honest, I thought that MongoDB was more similar to RavenDB but it ended up being quite different.

Ready to learn more about RavenDB? Check out my [Getting Started course](http://bit.ly/PSRavenDB4) on it so I was happy to work with HN to write an article on the subject.
