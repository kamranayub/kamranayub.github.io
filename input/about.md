My name is Kamran Ayub. I'm a professional developer and technologist based in Minneapolis, MN
and have been designing, building, and producing software for over 14 years. I've worked in multiple Fortune 500 companies
working on small to massive scale consumer-facing and line of business web applications.

## What I Do

I focus on improving user experience, business process efficiency, and
automation through software development and design. I have deep experience leveraging enterprise
and open-source technologies to help drive improvements for the business teams I work with.

I have worked in educational, manufacturing, and retail contexts doing web-based and desktop software development since 2006. I've helped
deliver solutions for million visitor consumer facing websites, automation for internal developer teams, cloud-native solutions for worldwide brands, and core business process automation. Even prior
to 2006, I helped clients build their brand and expand their businesses through web and marketing development.

Currently I focus on developing with modern web technologies and cloud-native solutions. I infuse a passion for user experience and improving efficiencies in everything I do. That means I don't _just_ execute someone else's vision, I partner with them to understand their problem and help design the best solution I can, even in my current employment. Ensuring I focus on the problem and work towards the solution means I help deliver software that meets future needs and is amenable to change.

## Work with Me

I am gainfully employed but am always open to the right opportunities on the side. Did you watch a talk or attend a workshop I gave
and want to follow up with me? Let's talk!

### Keep Track of My Games

[Keep Track of My Games](http://ktomg.com) is a way to organize your game collection and track new
releases. I started it in 2011 and have been running it solo ever since. I leverage the IGDB game database for my data. I actively work on this and am trying to build it into a more sustainable product that generates revenue.

[The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind](https://keeptrackofmygames.com/users/kamranicus/lists/favorites) is my favorite game.

### Excalibur.js

[Excalibur.js](http://excaliburjs.com) is a web-based game engine written in TypeScript. I work with
several other talented friends on the project. The project is free and open source. I primarily help
maintain the website, documentation, automation, and contribute to systems like input controls that
don't require a PhD in math or physics.

I participate in game jams which you can view on the [Projects page](/projects).
