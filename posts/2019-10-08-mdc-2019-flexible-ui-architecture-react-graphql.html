  <p>I had the opportunity to speak at <a href="https://mdc.ilmservices.com">MDC 2019</a> recently and recorded my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCawL3nAnUA&amp;list=PLmmRwaXW1nVTi2uv1vpy9B7pvI0X-vMc4&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s">Designing a Flexible UI Architecture with React and GraphQL</a>. I think it's even better than the version I gave <a href="https://kamranicus.com/posts/2019-02-01-ndc-minnesota-flexible-ui-with-react-graphql-typescript">at NDC MN</a> earlier this year.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-talk-about">What's the talk about?</h2>
<p>Here's the abstract:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If your application suffers from hard-to-debug UI state, complex client-side business rules, and has trouble scaling to meet your performance needs you might be tearing your hair out. In this session I will share how we shifted the way we thought about our application using a 3 step process from the ground up. I’ll show you how we built a declarative “schema-driven UI” engine built on React and GraphQL that could manage business complexity and still scale to meet future business requirements.</p>
<p>I'll share our approach, some challenges we faced and advice for your own applications so you can design your own declarative schema-driven UI architecture that fits your business needs. Don’t fret if you don’t use React or GraphQL because this pattern can be introduced into any framework you might be using.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-people-say">What did people say?</h2>
<p>Like I said, I thought this went even better than the one I gave at NDC (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIejhIX7ObE&amp;list=PLmmRwaXW1nVTi2uv1vpy9B7pvI0X-vMc4&amp;index=2">recording</a>).</p>
<p>This last session was rated <strong>4.3/5</strong> out of 25 ratings. 💖 Some specific feedback I got:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&quot;so much content!!!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&quot;useful approach&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&quot;very handy guide to UI design with any technology&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🙏 I was very happy to read these! I even had to cut out content to fit within 50 minutes.</p>
<p>I also had a couple people come up afterwards who said they thought the content was great and &quot;impressive.&quot; Great!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&quot;wish would of talked more generic graphQL and react to&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <em>think</em> this last comment was referring to maybe adding more introductory content around GraphQL/React. Totally fair but I think the case study and design methodology are the focal points and for an intermediate talk, I don't have enough time to introduce React much though I <em>do</em> spend at least 5-8 minutes on why GraphQL was a good fit for this architecture.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-change">What did I change?</h2>
<p>I made a few changes structurally to the presentation that I think made it even better this time around.</p>
<h3 id="wrote-a-script">Wrote a script</h3>
<p>What! Actually this is something I've had to admit about myself. It's better if I write out my thoughts first to get them in order and be more articulate. I have time to mull it over and edit. I did this on my last two courses and it made a real difference in quality.</p>
<p>Each of the slides now has full speaker notes and I practiced reading through it several times to get the flow and points straight that I wanted to make.</p>
<h3 id="cut-out-the-bio">Cut out the bio</h3>
<p>I got rid of the &quot;about me&quot; section and replaced with a single slide at the end with resources. I basically launch into the talk and <em>then at the end</em> when people have heard what I have to say, they can look me up. This was some advice I came across online from somewhere (maybe <a href="https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp">this</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzVr_nsKoZs&amp;feature=youtu.be">even this meta talk</a>) that I implemented.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-the-point">Start with the point</h3>
<p>My teacher in high school gave me this advice about speaking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&quot;Tell them what you want to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't know it until later but this advice actually originated from <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-baldoni/deliver-a-great-speech-aristotle-three-tips.html">Aristotle</a>. I am reading some books on rhetoric currently so that was neat to learn.</p>
<p>Even though I <em>knew this</em> intellectually it hit home more after we had an internal guest speaker at work, Frances Frei, talk about rebuilding trust. It was a lengthier version of her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVeq-0dIqpk">TED talk</a> which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>She says if you're having a hard time getting your point across, it may be because you take a long, winding road to get to your point. Instead, just <em>start with your point</em> and people will be more engaged.</p>
<p>So that's what I did, my second slide is the whole point of the presentation. Then I follow Aristotle's advice and summarize at the end.</p>
<h3 id="divide-into-3-parts">Divide into 3 parts</h3>
<p>Everything is better in threes. I divided the talk into 3 main sections and I think that really helped keep the flow and structure solid in people's minds.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-i-change">What would I change?</h2>
<p>Plenty. Each time I give a talk it surfaces more things I'd change.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to do more with the Adobe XD design I made: animations, callouts, etc.</li>
<li>I think I'll redo the GraphQL section next time.</li>
<li>I want to add a &quot;post-mortem&quot; section again, I took it out due to time but I might be able to save on time other places.</li>
<li>I would <strong>love</strong> to show a minimal demo/sample using one of the libraries I mention.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might have a chance to do these things, I've submitted the talk to several more conferences for 2020. Wish me luck!</p>
