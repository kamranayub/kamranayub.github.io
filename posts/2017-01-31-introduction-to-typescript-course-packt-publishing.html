  <p>I'm very excited to share that the course I've been working on the past few months, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/introduction-typescript-video">Introduction to TypeScript</a> is now available to purchase through Packt Publishing! I should have some discount codes to share soon (will Tweet/update when available).</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>My goals while developing the course were pretty simple:</p>
<p><strong>Provide background on TypeScript</strong></p>
<p>The first couple sections of the course focus on <em>why TypeScript.</em> Not only trying to answer, &quot;Why would I use TypeScript?&quot; but also, &quot;Why is TypeScript even a thing?&quot; I think it's important to understand <em>why</em> you're using a language and to understand the context in which to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Learn by doing</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the course the majority of content is presented inside of Visual Studio Code. Why? Because that's where <em>you'll</em> be working (or in some other IDE). After the first few introductory sections, the amount of slides I use in the rest of the course are mainly explanatory/summary slides. The rest <strong>is all in the code.</strong> Furthermore, I've built the course sample code to allow following along--each section has its own folder and it just starts at the final state, so you can begin where I leave off.</p>
<p>The other motivation to focus so much on actual coding is the fact that <strong>one of the primary reasons to use TypeScript is for productivity.</strong> And you just can't <em>tell</em> someone how much time they will save, you need to <em>prove</em> it. I hope by the sheer amount of coding samples I walk through that it will be crystal clear how useful TypeScript can be.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on real-world samples</strong></p>
<p>The middle of the course introduces language concepts and features by building a sample application from scratch. I purposefully designed an example that didn't assume prior knowledge of any other JavaScript framework or library--I want people to &quot;go in fresh.&quot; This is to allow the viewer to see TypeScript in a purely isolated context to learn the language and how to design their own applications from scratch. I cover environment setup, refactoring, and testing.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the course, I switch to migrating several &quot;vanilla&quot; JavaScript codebases. I intentionally chose <em>publically available projects.</em> Why? Because I knew if I wrote contrived samples to migrate I would be biased towards designing it with TypeScript in mind. Instead, I chose libraries that <strong>other people wrote</strong> so they could be more raw and real. The only thing I did was choose examples that would allow me to introduce more concepts and workflows that people might encounter in the real world <em>and</em> that could support migration in a reasonable time for a course.</p>
<h2 id="post-mortem">Post-mortem</h2>
<p>This was my first course I developed myself. I was happy with the folks I worked with at Packt and I think I did a good job planning out work. I did <em>not</em> do a good job at estimating the amount of time up front--I think I had anticipated a 3 hour course and the final time is about 8 hours. I'm very happy with all the produced content but <em>man</em> that was a terrible estimate. Now I know for the future what to expect so I'm hoping future courses will have better up-front time estimates.</p>
<p>The editors I worked with remarked that I was a very good author to work with and wondered what tips I could share to help other authors keep to their schedule (we finished early! The course was expected to be released in February). Each section was due about 6-7 days apart and this is how I split the work to make my evenings and weekends manageable:</p>
<p><strong>Code first (1-2 days)</strong></p>
<p>Each section comprises of about 3-4 videos. I would tackle one section at a time, where I'd begin by <em>writing all the code examples first</em>. Why? Because even I didn't quite know what I'd learn when I started writing the code. As I wrote the code, I'd take down notes on what I wanted to highlight, what obstacles I ran into, and I'd mentally picture how I'd walk through the code to get to the end result.</p>
<p>This is by far the most time-consuming phase of making the course and I'd usually do this part on Sundays and Tuesdays (that worked best for my schedule, see Punchcard below). It's also where I learned the most and did the most research.</p>
<p><strong>Content next (Evening)</strong></p>
<p>Once the code was written, I had a clear picture of where to begin and where to end. Then I'd spend time on the slides--writing up any content that needed an introduction or explanation, the goals of the section, and a summary of everything the viewer should have learned.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this is the step I should have written all the required metadata for. The metadata is required for distribution of the course and I waited until the end to do it all, it would be have been more efficient to do it during this step.</p>
<p>Almost exclusively I worked on this during the evenings in the week. Some presentations took longer to make than others, depending on how much content I needed to cover.</p>
<p><strong>Record last (Evening)</strong></p>
<p>After the code and slides were done, I recorded. Using the software provided, I recorded each video in a single session, usually after dinner. My wife would go downstairs with the dog and I'd let her know when I was done. There were only a couple sections where I had to split recording into two days, otherwise I could usually do it in one night. I'm a perfectionist, so any part of the session I messed up I just started that part over. Each minute of produced material was about 2.3 minutes of raw material, so for a 20 minute video I'd spend about 46 minutes recording. Mainly this was because I didn't write a script beforehand or anything, I just tried to &quot;present&quot; and when I stumbled or made a mistake, I'd just start that bit over again.</p>
<p>A few things I did to minimize headaches during editing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't move the mouse while speaking in case of mistakes/cutting</li>
<li>Minimize or eliminate parts of the screen that change dynamically (file explorer, clocks, taskbar, notifications)</li>
<li>Clear the terminal before each step. It would look weird to have different command history being shown between cuts</li>
<li>Ensure the mic was positioned consistently between sessions (I have a boom arm)</li>
<li>Ensure the mixer was always the same settings each session (I never touched the settings after I started recording the first video)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the end result turned out really well because of the steps I took to minimize how much of the screen/sound changed during recording. All in all, I don't think any section took more than 2-4 hours to record.</p>
<p><strong>Don't be afraid to change the outline</strong></p>
<p>The original outline of the course was a bit different than what ended up being final. As I worked through each section, sometimes topics that I had planned to cover later came up sooner than expected. Rather than trying to avoid it, I just modified the outline to compensate. Overall, there was only one case where I had to move/merge sections and the editors were able to work with me on it--it ended up being way better than the original plan I had.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>I can use these basic stats to help estimate any other courses I work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raw unedited video:</strong> 19 hours, 5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Final produced video:</strong> 8 hours, 17 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Days to produce:</strong> Nov 11 - Jan 18 (68 days or 10 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Course sample code commits:</strong> 78</li>
<li><strong>Estimated time spent</strong>: 60-80 hours (6-8 hours per week)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Git Commit Punchcard</strong></p>
<p><img src="images%5C2017-01-31-course-punchcard.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Git punchcard" /></p>
<p>You can see clearly that the majority of time was spent in the evenings but hardly after midnight--there was one instance I had to stay up a bit late to finish. You can also see I took advantage of my holiday break (Thanksgiving and Christmas) to work during the day. Sun-Tue were coding days whereas Wed-Fri were mainly recording or content creation. Thu-Sat nights were almost always free, perfect for spending time with friends and getting <a href="https://kamranicus.com/posts/2017-01-02-year-in-review">other work done</a>.</p>
<p>Data is useful, especially to understand how much time goes into an endeavor like this--time is money, after all. For subsequent courses I plan to store <em>all</em> course material in Git (including slides/metadata) and also use something like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> to track my time spent in the background. That will give me a much clearer picture of time spent on the course.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>While it would be ideal to do the follow-up course to this one immediately, I didn't know what my schedule would look like after my first kiddo arrives. The editors and I agreed that it didn't make sense for me to commit to doing another course so soon with such an unknown schedule. Once I have some idea of how much time I have, I'll be thinking about other courses. It's more important that I spend time with little Ayub first.</p>
